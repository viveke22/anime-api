# Anime REST API

A simple RESTful API built with Node.js and Express.js that fetches and serves anime data from a remote JSON source. It provides endpoints to retrieve all animes, get a random anime, and more. This project is ideal for learning backend development, API design, and integrating external data sources.

## Features
- Fetches anime data dynamically from a GitHub raw JSON URL.
- Endpoints for listing all animes and getting a random recommendation.
- Returns data in HTML format for easy browser testing (can be extended to JSON).
- Lightweight and easy to deploy.

## Tech Stack
- **Node.js**: Runtime environment.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for routing and middleware.
- **Native Fetch API**: For retrieving remote JSON data (Node.js v18+ compatible).
